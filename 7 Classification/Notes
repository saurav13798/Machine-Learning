classification:
Target Feature => categorical in nature
Binary : email spam or email not spam
2 classes / segments/ groups
Multi Class : Email Promotional or Email Social or EMail Important section

titanic survival:
1 : yes => people survived
0 : no => people have not survived

movie ratings/employee ratings:
1 - lowest
2
3
4
5 - highest

Evaluation Metrics:
precision
recall
accuracy
f1-score, f1-beta score

Evaluation Metrics for classification:
precision/recall/accuracy => >0.80 then we consider that model for final predictions

precision: total true positives/(predicted positives)
when the scenario demands negatives to be considered as negatives only
and doesn't want them to be falsely considered as positives.
indirect => false positive should be as less as possible
example: important email(offer letter, financial aggrements) considered as spam

recall: total true positives/(actual positives) 
when the scenario demands positives to be considered atmost priority
but model is predicting them as negatives
indirect => false negative should be as less as possible
example: diabetic patient is considered as non diabetic.

accuracy:
when the scenario doesnt demand much about positives and negatives(generic scenario), you can check accuracy

f1-score:
Useful in scenarios where both false positives and false negatives are equally undesirable

f1-beta score:
Allows you to adjust the importance of recall relative to precision using the "beta" parameter. 
When beta > 1, recall is more important than precision. 
When beta < 1, precision is more important than recall. 
Useful when one type of error (false positive or false negative) is more critical than the other. 




Evaluation Metrics for Regression:
Mean squared error
Mean absolute error
RMSE
R2 score=> Coefficient of Determination
r2 score >0.80 then we consider that model for final predictions

Flow for building an accurate Machine Learning Model:

Data Ingestion/Gathering
Basic data quality checks
Separate x and y
data preprocessing and cleaning
train test split
model building
model evaluation
final model for out of sample predictions
